title: How do I create a new group?
---
Group creation is presently closed, and is not likely to reopen. 

However, the current set of groups is intended to encompass a full range of Computer Science subjects. Take some time and read the posts in these groups, and you are quite likely to find something of interest to you. You are also encouraged to start your own discussions in groups you like to attract attention to your own particular interests.
